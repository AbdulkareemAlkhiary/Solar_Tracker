= Solar Tracker

The objective of this project is use a servo motor to turn a set of light sensors towards a light source.
This system could be used to keep a solar cell pointed directly at the sun. A time of day and angle
readout (LCD) are expected. 

== Step 1: Assemble the circuit

Assemble the circuit following the diagram Schematic_SolarTracker.png attached to the sketch

BOM: 
 1. Arduino Board
 2. Servo Motor
 3. One Resistor
 4. Two Light Sensors

== Step 2: Load the code

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board
